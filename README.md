Therapeutic Robotic Interactive Canine Companion (TRICC) is an interactive and lovable companion robotic pet dog with a customizable and detachable busy blanket that is mainly designed for people with dementia. TRICC helps provide sensory stimulation and soothing effects to people with dementia by reacting to a user's petting like a real dog (e.g., head nudging, and tail wagging) and carrying a userâ€™s personalized busy blanket.
